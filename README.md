### 🧠 How I Think

I don’t build for trends.  
I build to understand **how systems behave** — under load, over time, and at scale.

I care about:
- Structure before speed  
- Clarity before complexity  
- Intelligence as infrastructure, not a feature  

> Code evolves. Systems endure.

---

### ⚙️ What I Work On

- AI / ML fundamentals focused on reasoning and behavior  
- System-oriented full stack applications  
- Clean architecture and data flow  
- Interfaces that feel intentional, not accidental  

I prefer fewer projects — **but deeper ones**.

---

### 🧩 Current Focus

- Designing maintainable application systems  
- Strengthening AI + backend fundamentals  
- Understanding failure modes and recovery  
- Building things meant to outlast frameworks

### 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C, C++, Rust, Dart, TypeScript  Java  
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, APIs, databases  
- **AI/ML:** Core ML concepts, model integration
